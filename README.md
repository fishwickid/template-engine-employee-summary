Employee Generator App
# Employee Summary App
---

This app will help any employer easily create a summary of all their employees based on their role in their company including all of their contact details. 

This application was built using NODE.js to create all of the employee profiles with the Inquirer module and Jest for test driven development. 

The key functionality to make the code clean and easy to use for future development was the use of Javascript Classes and constructor functions.


## Installation: 

1. Clone the repository locally  
2. Make sure you have NODE.js installed
3. Install all of the dependencies (Inquirer, Jest)


## Usage 

1. In terminal - node app.js
2. Answer all the prompted questions
3. Add another profile or choose no to render the html
4. See the employee's profiles rendered in the output folder
